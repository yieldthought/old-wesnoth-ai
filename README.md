# old-wesnoth-ai
An old copy of the AI from http://yieldthought.com/post/95722882055/machine-learning-teaches-me-how-to-write-better-ai

I don't recall exactly when or why I stopped playing with this, so it might not be in a super state. I'm pretty sure it can only fight as the undead in its current state; unit type selection is something I never got around to porting over from a previous python AI for example. It does still play and win test games though.

Last tested with Wesnoth 1.11.15

I just about recall that to install this you need to put yt.lua here:

    ~/.local/share/wesnoth/1.11/data/add-ons/AI-demos/lua/
    
and yt\_simple.cfg here:

    ~/.local/share/wesnoth/1.11/data/add-ons/AI-demos/ais/


The included wesrun script will run one fight between this AI and the default and print some stats to stdout.

This is all experimental but a couple of people asked for it. May you have good luck!
